## Step 2: Create Git Worktree with the harness's native worktree tool

If the harness provides a native worktree primitive — for example an `EnterWorktree` / `WorktreeCreate` tool, a `/worktree` command, or a `--worktree` flag — use it and stop. Native tools place, track, and clean up the worktree so the harness can manage it. A behind-the-back `git worktree add` creates phantom state the harness cannot see, navigate to, or clean up.
